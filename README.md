# Employee-Tracker
SUMMARY

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. 
These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). 
This project is a command-line application built from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
